Last Orders is a card-based drinking game that I started creating in August of 2023.

I started creating Last Orders just as something to use with my friends on a weekend. I did not anticipate it to become something that I would eventually release to the App Store to the world. It just worked out that way. It started off as a really basic game, with no images, and some horrendous CSS. However, I started really enjoying adding in little features to the game, and updating it every other week from feedback from my mates. Eventually, I decided to make the game into a website, and then an app on the Google Play Store.

Last Orders is created using ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 as shown in the tech stack below. I started off by going into photoshop and designing wireframes for how I wanted each page to look and function. This then became a design document including a Brand Manual which includes all of the hex colour codes. I took all of my documentation and just started creating the game. After a few weeks of developing the game in my spare time, the first version was created, simply called "Brandons Drinking Game". After deciding that I was incredibly proud of my work, I came up with the name and logo of the game and added more and more features were added such as the Earthquake, Boozenami and the Chest. The game has continued to recieve little updates and added features and cards until this day.

I want to get Last Orders on IOS, which is currently being worked on. I then will continue to being releasing updates to the game every other month, including new features, new cards and updated graphics. I want to get all of the graphics in the game to become animations that smoothly flow across the screen. I also want to continue expanding the social media associated with the game and get the game to as many people as possible.
